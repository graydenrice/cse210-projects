The Reference class will get the parts of the reference (book, chaper, verse(s)) then put them together in a string.
The Scripture class will take the info from the Reference class and add the text to the end to combine the reference and the text,
the Scripture class also will put the text into a list, which will be taken by the Word class which will change the bool of each item
depending on its status (hidden or shown) and change the display of hiden words to "_" which is sent to the scripture class.
the scripture class then string together the words and puts in the rendered text.
